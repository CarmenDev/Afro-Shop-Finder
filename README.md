First own mini JavaScript project - 08/20/20

This single page application (SPA) helps users find afro shops, restaurants and clubs in Germany thanks to a search by city or ZIP code. When the user enters a city (in English) or a ZIP code and clicks on the type of place they are looking for, the search results appear on the right side of the screen and are materialized on the Google map with markers. The page needs to be reloaded to search for a new shop, restaurant or club or consult another link. <br>

Relevance: no such application exists in Germany to this day. The goal is to provide and increase visibility. <br>
Keywords: HTML, CSS, DOM, JSON, SPA, forms, events, Google Maps API <br>

What I found easy: concept, design <br>
What I found difficult: markers automation, formatting coordinates for the JSON files <br>

As soon as we learn how to build mobile apps, this project will be extended and users will be able to register their shop, club or restaurant.
