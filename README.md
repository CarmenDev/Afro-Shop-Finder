First own mini JavaScript project - 08/20/20

This single page application (SPA) prototype helps users find afro shops, restaurants and clubs in Germany thanks to a search by city or ZIP code. When the user enters a city (in English) or a ZIP code and clicks on the type of place they are looking for, the search results appear on the right side of the screen and are materialized on the Google map with markers. The page needs to be reloaded to search for a new shop, restaurant or club or consult another link. <br>
