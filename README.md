First own mini JavaScript project - 08/17/20

This single page application (SPA) helps users find afro shops, restaurants and clubs in Germany thanks to a search by city or ZIP code. The search results appear on the right side of the screen and are materialized on the Google map with markers.

Relevance: no such application exists to this day. The goal is to provide and increase visibility. <br>
Keywords: HTML, CSS, DOM, JSON, SPA, forms, Google Maps API <br>

What I found easy: concept, design <br>
What I found difficult: markers automation when loading the search results <br>

As soon as we learn how to build mobile apps, this project will be extended and users will be able to register their shop, club or restaurant. <br>
This app is meant to eventually take on an international scope.
